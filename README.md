# Intro to VR Research Project

This project will focus on implementing several different ways for a player to swim

**Name: Patrick Hunt**

## Interaction Description

The interaction for this project will be swimming, and it will focus on different ways that players can interact with an underwater environment to move themselves around. The 3 different implementations of such movement are described below.
#### Implementation #1: Thrusters
   *   The first implementation of this interaction will involve an implementation of small thrusters on the player's hands. The player will be able to point their hands in a specific direction and generate thrust so as to move in a specific direction. The thrusters will be activated by a button press on the controller. 
#### Implementation #2: 
   *   Test
#### Implementation #3
   *   Test
## Storyboards

*Also provide a short storyboard for each interaction (can be hand-drawn stick figures) that shows how you envision they will play out.*
