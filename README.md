# Intro to VR Research Project

This project will focus on implementing several different ways for a player to swim in an underwater environment.

**Name: Patrick Hunt**

## Interaction Description
The interaction for this project will be swimming, and it will focus on different ways that players can interact with an underwater environment to move around. The 3 different implementations of such movement are described below.
#### Implementation #1: Thrusters
   *   The first implementation of this interaction will involve an implementation of small thrusters on the player's hands. The player will be able to point their hands in a specific direction and generate thrust so as to move in a specific direction. The thrusters will be activated by a trigger press on the controller. Pressing both triggers simultaneously will activate both thrusters at the same time.
#### Implementation #2: Speargun Grappling Hook 
   *   This implementation of the swimming interaction will feature a speargun held by the player. The player will be able to shoot the speargun at an object and will then be able to reel in the speargun to move themself towards the location where the object is attached. The speargun will shoot when the right trigger is pressed, and a button on the right controller will allow the player to reel it in.
#### Implementation #3: Generic Swimming Treading Movement
   *   The last implementation allows the player to tread water with their hands as if they are actually swimming. The more that a player moves their hand, the more they will move. In order to move, the player must be holding the trigger on the controller corresponding to the hand they wish to use to tread water. Both  triggers held will assume both hands are being used to move.
